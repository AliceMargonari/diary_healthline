  <p>There has long been controversy about whether eating dairy causes acne, and research is still emerging.</p>
  <p>“It’s suggested that certain types of dairy may contribute to acne. This is likely due to dairy increasing insulin secretion and IGF-1 levels, which can lead to increased levels of androgen hormones and sebum production,” Jillian Greaves, MPH, RD, LDN, an integrative and functional dietitian, told Healthline.</p>
  <p>Many observational studies have explored the relationship between acne and different types of dairy, including milk of various fat contents, cheese, and ice cream. These studies have yielded inconsistent conclusions. Although observational studies suggest a relationship, there’s not enough or the right type of data to suggest a cause-and-effect relationship. Many studies on dairy and acne rely on people recalling what they have eaten, which can be a flawed data collection method, and on subjective assessments of how severe the acne is.</p>
  <p>So, while dairy may be problematic for some people, the link isn’t as straightforward as people often make it out to be. We need more high quality research into the potential relationship between dairy and acne.</p>
